## Introduction to the Citation File Format


The [Citation File Format (CFF)](https://citation-file-format.github.io/) is a format for files that contain citation metadata for software.
It has been developed to make it easier for software authors to provide the complete and correct set of citation metadata for their software projects.

CFF files are called `CITATION.cff`.
They are meant to live together with the source code of the software, usually in a source code repository.
`CITATION.cff` files can also be shipped together with the software, for example when software is distributed in downloadable archives.

One of the main aims of CFF is to make these metadata files accessible for both humans and machines.
To achieve this, CFF files are written in a data serialization markup language called YAML.
YAML is often used for software configuration files, and therefore there is a chance that software developers already know it.

The contents of a simple CFF file are shown below, but CFF can do more than this, which you will learn about in the following sections.

```yaml
cff-version: 1.2.0
message: "If you use this software, please cite it as below."

## Very brief introduction to YAML

One of the features of YAML is that it uses very few actual markup symbols.
This makes it easier to read than languages that make extensive use of brackets to structure data, such as JSON.

YAML uses so called "block collections", where each entry begins on its own line, and the scope is defined using indentation.

For data structures, YAML most importantly defines collections:

- *mappings*, where data is provided as key-value pairs such as `foo: bar`, and
- *sequences*, where each entry starts with a dash and a whitespace, followed by the data value, as in `- Entry 1`.

Mappings and sequences can be mixed as well.
This means that you can map keys to sequences, as in the following example. We could call those "named lists".

```yaml
colors:
  - green
  - white
  - orange
  - blue
```

You can also have sequences of mappings, as in the following example, where we could call each entry an "anonymous object".

```yaml
-
  age: 23
  name: Kim
-
  age: 42
  name: Alex
```

Values in YAML have different data types, similar to programming languages.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: instructor

In the YAML specification, this is worded less intuitively:

> A YAML node represents a single native data structure. Such nodes have content of one of three kinds: scalar, sequence or mapping. 
> In addition, each node has a tag which serves to restrict the set of possible values the content can have.

This episode uses "mappings" and "sequences", but not "scalars".
Should learners ask about this, either refer them to the [YAML specifications](https://yaml.org/spec/) themselves,
or give them the definition of "scalar", which for YAML 1.2.2 is:

> The content of a scalar node is an opaque datum that can be presented as a series of zero or more Unicode characters.

The Citation File Format uses a small subset of what the YAML specifications provide:

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints 

- The Citation File Format (CFF) is a human- and machine-readable file format for software citation metadata.
- Valid CFF files are called `CITATION.cff` and contain YAML data.
- The CFF *schema* defines what fields and values a CFF file can and must have.
- CFF can provide comprehensive citation metadata for a software (version).
- CFF can provide metadata for another output that should be cited in addition to the software itself.
- CFF can provide the references for a software, e.g., its dependencies.
